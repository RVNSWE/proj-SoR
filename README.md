PROJECT SOR:

This project was created to teach myself C# back when I could only write simple console applications. I didn't know
about design patterns, architecture, Clean Code or SOLID principles, and developed this codebase organically through
trial and error. The goal of this project was to learn to code, not to engineer.

It's nevertheless somehow become a fully working 2D, top-down game engine with traversible maps, collision
detection and interactions, character and interactable object animations, projectiles / spell casting (in progress),
working menus, dynamically interchangeable X-Box controller and keyboard support, and a save and load feature. I
polish as I go, so everything I've implemented works as intended with no known bugs... although good luck trying
to figure out how.

LIBRARIES AND TOOLS:

Spine :-
Spine is proprietary skeletal animation software from Esoteric Software LLC. The Spine Runtimes work with output from the
Spine Editor to provide animations and skins. All art was created and animated by me. Please refer to the licenses section
below.

MonoGame :-
MonoGame is a free and open-source (FOSS) .NET framework for creating video games with C#. It's a re-implementation
of Microsoft's discontinued XNA Framework. It's not an engine itself, but provides all the bones to make one with.

MonoGame.Extended :-
A FOSS library for use with MonoGame.
